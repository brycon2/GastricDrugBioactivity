# GastricDrugBioactivity
The purpose of this project is to create an app that can be used to predict a drug's ability to inhibit gastric H/K ATPase to help lower stomach acidity in acute and long-term cases.

Checkout the deployed model [here](https://brycon2-gastricdrugbioactivity-app-gn1jup.streamlitapp.com/)!

Model selection and hyperparameter searching can be seen in [GastricActivity.ipynb](./GastricActivity.ipynb). An abstract can be found here if you just want a quick look.

The app's code can be found at [app.py](app.py).

Java JRE version 6+ is required in order to use PaDEL-descriptor and get molecular information.

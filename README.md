# GastricDrugBioactivity
The purpose of this project is to create an app that can be used to predict a drug's ability to inhibit gastric H/K ATPase to help lower stomach acidity in acute and long-term cases.

Model selection and hyperparameter searching can be seen in [GastricActivity.ipynb](./GastricActivity.ipynb). An abstract can be found here if you just want a quick look.

Deployment of the best model, a K-NN model, in interactive app form can be seen here with the code at [app.py](./app.py). A test upload file can be found at [test.txt](./test.txt).

Java JRE version 6+ is required in order to use PaDEL-descriptor and get molecular information.
